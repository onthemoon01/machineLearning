To see the complete html file, follow https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github/onthemoon01/machineLearning/blob/master/MachineProject2.html to view my html file.
Or type the url of my repo at https://htmlpreview.github.io
Finally, if it does not work, you can still follow the .rmd link in my repo, but you will not see the plot...
By the way, I tried to create a gh-page but this didn't help in making the html page more readable.
